## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_agent.git
cd ai_agent
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast environment management and dependency installation.

1. **Install uv** (if you don't have it):

   ```bash
   brew install uv
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   uv venv .venv
   ```

3. **Activate the environment:**

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install all dependencies:**

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or, if you use `pyproject.toml`:

   ```bash
   uv sync .
   ```

## 📚 Create Knowledge Base

1. Create a new folder in the `knowledge` directory.
2. Create new files in the folder.
3. Add the content of the file to the knowledge base.

## 💻 Running the Project Locally

### Run the Main Application

```bash
python main.py
```

- The main entry point is `main.py`.

### Environment Variables

- You will need to set the following environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `MONGO_URI`
- `MONGO_DB_CLIENT`
- `MONGO_DB_COLLECTION`

If you want to deploy in huggingface, you will need to set the following environment variables:

- `HF_TOKEN`

## 🤔 How It Works

1. **Knowledge Ingestion:**  
   The system loads knowledge from text files and stores embeddings in ChromaDB.

2. **Chat & RAG:**  
   The chat agent uses retrieval-augmented generation to answer questions, pulling relevant context from the knowledge base.

3. **Extensible Tools:**  
   Easily add new tools or evaluators in the `chat/` directory to expand your agent’s capabilities.
